# sorin-markov-chains
Second-order Markov chain implementation, designed to generate flavor texts for Magic: The Gathering. Also includes functions to flavor texts from ScryFall's API and OAuth methods, written from scratch, to authenticate to Twitter.

/local/ folder contains a old version of the code, designed to be run locally. The version in the main folder is deployed to Herokuapp to interface with a Postgres server and set to automatically post every hour.
